In order to start the project use eclipse or intelij IDEA
**pom.xml** file has all necessary dependencies to build the project.

The project utilizes page object model and has a base login page and
a couple of test to check login functionality.

The project tests a web-page with Selenium, TestNg and Maven.

In order to run the tests please start the project with:

Go to Run → Edit Configurations.
Select your TestNG configuration.
Under Suite, select "Suite XML files" instead of "Class".
Click "+" → Select your actual testng.xml file` (from your project root).
Click Apply → OK and run the test.

We are not exposing creds of the app and this is why we use textng.xml
approach. And store values inside that file.
